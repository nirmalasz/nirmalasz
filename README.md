## 🌱 About Me

Hi! I’m **Nirmala** – a first-year Computer Engineering student at Universitas Indonesia.  
I’m passionate about **technology that empowers people**, especially in feminist contexts.

I love exploring:
- 🎮 **Game Development** – bringing narratives to life with code  
- 🖥️ **Computer Engineering** – understanding systems inside out  
- 🛠️ **Building Projects** – tools that matter, not just portfolio-fillers  
- ✊ **Political Discourse** – feminism, justice, and equity in tech spaces  
- ✍️ **Drawing & Reading** – because tech should be human-centered  

Currently active in:
- **Exercise FTUI** (Finance & Secretary Staff)  
- **BEM FTUI – Kajian dan Aksi Strategis** (Staff)
